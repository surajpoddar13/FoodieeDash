FoodieeDash is a simple and interactive food order management dashboard built using Streamlit. It allows guests to select food from multiple screens and stores their order details in a CSV file. Admins can log in with a username and password to view all guest orders, track total sales, and analyze food popularity using visual charts. The dashboard includes bar and line graphs for sales insights, all styled with a clean orange (#FF9913) theme. Itâ€™s perfect for learning how to manage user input, file storage, and data visualization in a web app.
